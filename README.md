# UI-UX-Experiment1

## Aim

To explore the Hands-on UI/UX Experiments.

## Algorithm:
```
1.Learn UI/UX basics (design, flows, usability).
2.Create UI mockups and UX user flows.
3.nalyze UI vs UX using real apps (Airbnb, Duolingo).
4.Redesign poor UI/UX examples.
5.Use tools (Figma, Miro, Adobe XD, etc.) to design and test prototypes.
```
## Output:
*Developed a strong understanding of the core principles of UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience), including visual hierarchy, interaction design, usability, and user satisfaction.

*Created and refined basic UI elements such as login screens using  minimalist design principles, emphasizing visual clarity, button placement, and input field accessibility.

*Successfully mapped user flows for common app interactions (e.g., app launch → login process), enhancing the ability to design seamless task completion journeys.

*Analyzed the difference between UI and UX through real-world case studies like Airbnb and Duolingo: • Airbnb: Showed how clean UI supports a frictionless booking experience (UX). • Duolingo: Demonstrated how playful UI enhances daily engagement and motivation (UX).

*Practiced redesigning poor interfaces by identifying both UI flaws (e.g., inconsistent fonts, poor color contrast) and UX issues (e.g., confusing navigation, missing error feedback), followed by mockups using tools like Figma.

*Explored and used professional tools for real-world UI/UX design workflows: • Figma: Built responsive interface prototypes with interactive links between screens. • Miro: Created user personas, journey maps, and wireframes to visualize and plan experiences. • Adobe XD, Sketch, InVision: Designed screens, added animations, enabled team collaboration, and gathered stakeholder feedback. • Axure RP: Simulated advanced interactions like real-time validation and conditional flows.

*Conducted usability testing by sharing prototypes with peers, collecting feedback, and iterating designs to improve user-friendliness and clarity.

*Strengthened understanding of how UI and UX are interdependent: • Good UI supports effective UX (e.g., clear buttons aid navigation). • Poor UI can hinder UX regardless of how well the journey is planned.

*Gained practical experience in building full-cycle design projects—from user research and wireframing to prototyping and testing.

*The overall outcome was a comprehensive, tool-based, user-centered approach to designing digital products that are not only visually appealing but also highly functional, accessible, and enjoyable to use.
## Result:
Built basic app screens and user flows, understood UI vs UX roles, used tools like Figma and Miro, and created interactive prototypes with user feedback.
